  <description>Welcome to the website of Khulna University. Khulna University bears a distinct significance due to its location in the divisional headquarter Khulna â€“ the third largest metropolitan city of Bangladesh. This university started its academic program in 1991, and now it has established itself as a center of excellence in the arena of higher education in Bangladesh. Khulna University aims to produce well-rounded individuals capable of thinking in a comprehensive way. Our website will, I hope, give you a flavor of what makes our university special, in terms of our academic expertise and hands-on relationship with the world outside, whether you are a prospective student, colleague or an employer.

Khulna University is the first public university to have acted as a powerful performer in the economic and cultural life of the southwestern region of Bangladesh. This university is free from all political unrest until now. Therefore, here prevails a congenial atmosphere for carrying out research activities by the students and the faculty. The university has a highly qualified faculty imparting instructions and providing persistent supervision to the students in the fields of Science, Engineering and Technology, Life Science, Business Studies, Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities and Fine Arts. Our academic programs and services are driven by the needs of our community and economy from a global context. Hence, many of our graduates have been working across the globe with reputation and pride. The university, in future, will continue to enhance the quality of research, introduce subjects having global significance and adopt the state of the art technology and fruitful academic collaboration.

It is my pleasure to welcome you to Khulna University and invite you to be a member of the community that strives for excellence.</description>
